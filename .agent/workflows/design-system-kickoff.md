# Design System Kickoff Workflow

This workflow uses the `ui-ux-pro-max` skill to generate a comprehensive design system for your project.

1.  **Define Project Scope**
    *   What is the **Project Name**?
    *   Describe the **Product Type** and **Industry** (e.g., "SaaS dashboard for fintech", "Wellness app for ios").
    *   List any specific **Style Keywords** (e.g., "minimal", "dark mode", "playful").

2.  **Generate Design System**
    *   Execute the following command, replacing the placeholders with your inputs:
    ```bash
    python3 .agent/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "[Product Type] [Industry] [Style Keywords]" --design-system --persist -p "[Project Name]"
    ```
    *(Note: Using `--persist` saves the system to `design-system/MASTER.md` for future use)*

3.  **Verify & Summarize**
    *   Read the generated file: `design-system/MASTER.md`
    *   **Action for Agent:** Create a summary of the design system, highlighting:
        *   **Primary Colors**: Hex codes and usage.
        *   **Typography**: Selected font families.
        *   **Core UI Style**: (e.g., Glassmorphism, Flat).
        *   **Anti-Patterns**: What to avoid for this specific industry.

4.  **Next Steps**
    *   The design system is now established! You can now start building features.
    *   *Tip:* When building a specific page, use the **Feature Implementation Spec** workflow to get page-specific guidance.
